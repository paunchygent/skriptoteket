# Session Handoff

Keep this file updated so the next session can pick up work quickly.

## Editing Rules (do not break structure)

- Keep the headings and section order exactly as-is; only fill in content.
- Use short bullets; include key file paths (e.g., `src/...`, `docs/...`) and exact commands.
- Do not paste large code blocks; link to files instead.
- Never include secrets/tokens/passwords or personal data.
- If you need to write a **chat message** to a new developer/agent, use `.agent/next-session-instruction-prompt-template.md` instead (this file is not that message).
