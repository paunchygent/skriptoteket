## Implementation Contract

The Hjälp panel, its topics, tutorial and MicroHelp keep their layout and move onto the shared package that
ST-SKRIPT-40-01 adopted. Paths are under `frontend/apps/skriptoteket/src/`.

Screens and folders:

- `components/help/`: `HelpPanel.vue`, `HelpIndex.vue`,
  `HelpTopicLayout.vue`, `HelpButton.vue`, `MicroHelp.vue`, the topic
  components under `components/help/topics/` and the tutorial under
  `components/help/tutorial/`.

What changes:

- Colours, surfaces, borders and type use the shared tokens through
  token-mapped utilities or CSS variables.
- Every button renders from the package action-button stylesheet adopted by
  TASK-SKRIPT-40-01-03 or from a shared dense button component in
  `components/ui/shared/`. Local button styling and local
  overrides of the `.btn-*` classes go.
- Where the area hand-rolls a control that the shared subtree exports (dense
  action, icon and status components, spinner, segmented toggle,
  SystemMessage), it uses the shared component.
- Panels, cards and surfaces carry no hard offset shadow and no heavy frame:
  flat surfaces use hairline borders, floating layers the soft shadow-md, and
  press and hover feedback is colour only.

What stays: the placement and order of every element, the breakpoints and the
workflow.

Out of scope: `components/layout/` (the shell) and the exam workspace, both ST-SKRIPT-40-04; where the shell places the Hjälp entry point.

Coordination: TASK-SKRIPT-08-36-02 (in progress) keeps Hjälp and the account actions
reachable at every width through the signed-in header and navigation drawer.
This area is frozen only while its refresh pair works on it.

## Contract Inputs

- ST-SKRIPT-40-03 terms G6, G7, G9, G11, G12, G29, S1 and S7.
- TASK-SKRIPT-40-01-02 (shared Vue subtree and the 0.1.24 sync with the local
  shadow sweep) and TASK-SKRIPT-40-01-03 (package action buttons).
- `huleedu-ui-design` for the panel, card, button and token treatment;
  `integrated-frontend-stack` for token mechanics.
- Area facts:
  `.orchestration/context/sessions/01a1495e-8398-75be-b2da-f0b08ba11afa/evidence/discovery/planning-facts-2026-10-17.md`.

## Core Vertical And Performance

A teacher opens Hjälp, browses the index, opens a topic and the tutorial, and
opens a MicroHelp hint on a screen. Every screen has the same layout as before; buttons, panels and
status markers come from the shared package. No request or data flow changes,
and no material performance concern is identified.

## Validation

- Focused Vitest: `pdm run fe-test` with the existing specs under `components/help/` (for example
  `HelpPanel.spec.ts`, `MicroHelp.spec.ts` and the tutorial specs), updated where they assert
  removed local classes.
- `pdm run fe-type-check` and `pdm run fe-build`.
- The task evidence lists every divergence from the shared core that the area keeps, for registration when TASK-SKILL-REP-0280 lands (ST-SKRIPT-40-03 G29).
- Gate: an independent Sol review and a real browser walk (Hemma,
  `staging-walk`) of the Hjälp panel, a topic, the tutorial and a MicroHelp hint with phone, tablet and desktop screenshots. No Opus
  step.

## Stop Conditions

- A screen cannot take a shared token, button or component without a layout
  change: stop and report to the user.
- The shared package lacks a token, button variant or component the area needs:
  report it upstream; do not patch synced files or add a local fork.
