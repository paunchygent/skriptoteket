SUMMARY:
The code provides a utility for extracting ZIP files with basic functionality and includes tests. The implementation handles directory creation and file extraction but lacks some robustness and security checks.

SCORECARD:
correctness: 4 - The function works for basic cases but has potential issues with path traversal.
security: 2 - No protection against malicious ZIP files with path traversal attacks.
performance: 3 - Efficient for small files but could be optimized for larger files.
maintainability: 3 - Code is readable but lacks type hints for all parameters and error handling.
tests: 3 - Tests cover basic functionality but miss edge cases like path traversal.

FINDINGS:
1) high - archive_utils.py - Missing path traversal protection
   Evidence: No validation of `name` in `extract_zip` before creating target paths.
   Impact: Vulnerable to ZIP slip attacks where files can be written outside the destination directory.
   Fix: Normalize and validate paths to ensure they are within the destination directory.

2) medium - archive_utils.py - Inconsistent type hints
   Evidence: `zip_path` and `dest_dir` use `str | Path` but internal conversions to `str` may cause issues.
   Impact: Potential type-related bugs if `Path` objects are used in certain contexts.
   Fix: Use `Path` consistently throughout the function and avoid converting to `str`.

3) low - test_archive_utils.py - Missing edge case tests
   Evidence: No tests for path traversal or malformed ZIP files.
   Impact: Reduced confidence in the robustness of the implementation.
   Fix: Add tests for path traversal attempts and malformed ZIP files.

FIX PLAN:
- [ ] Add path traversal protection by normalizing and validating paths in `extract_zip`.
- [ ] Update type hints to use `Path` consistently and remove unnecessary `str` conversions.
- [ ] Add tests for path traversal attempts and malformed ZIP files.
- [ ] Add error handling for cases like corrupted ZIP files or permission issues.
