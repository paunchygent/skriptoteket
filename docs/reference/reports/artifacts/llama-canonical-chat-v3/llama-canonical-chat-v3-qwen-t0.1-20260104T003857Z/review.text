SUMMARY:
The code implements a basic zip extraction utility that handles nested directories and writes files to disk. The test suite verifies basic functionality with simple file structures. There are no obvious correctness issues, but the implementation lacks security checks for path traversal vulnerabilities and could be improved in terms of error handling and performance for large files.

SCORECARD:
correctness: 4 - Function correctly extracts zip contents to target directory
security: 2 - Vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to lack of sanitization
performance: 3 - Reads entire file into memory at once, not optimal for large files
maintainability: 4 - Clean and straightforward implementation with good documentation
tests: 4 - Basic test coverage for core functionality

FINDINGS:
1) high - archive_utils.py - Path Traversal Vulnerability
   Evidence: target_path = os.path.join(dest_dir, name)
   Impact: Malicious zip files could write outside of dest_dir by using ../ in filenames
   Fix: Sanitize extracted paths to prevent directory traversal attacks

2) medium - archive_utils.py - Memory Usage for Large Files
   Evidence: data = src.read()
   Impact: Entire file contents loaded into memory at once, could cause OOM issues
   Fix: Implement streaming or chunked reading for large files

3) low - archive_utils.py - Missing Error Handling
   Evidence: No try/except blocks around file operations
   Impact: Unhandled exceptions during extraction could crash the program
   Fix: Add appropriate error handling for file I/O operations

FIX PLAN:
- [ ] Add path sanitization to prevent directory traversal
- [ ] Implement streaming read for large files
- [ ] Add try/except blocks for robust error handling
- [ ] Consider adding logging for debugging extraction issues
