SUMMARY:
The code implements a basic zip extraction utility that handles nested directories and writes files to disk. The test verifies basic functionality by creating a zip with nested files and checking their contents after extraction. There are no obvious security issues, but the implementation could be improved for robustness against path traversal attacks and edge cases.

SCORECARD:
correctness: 4 - The function correctly extracts files and handles nested directories, though it lacks protection against path traversal.
security: 2 - No safeguards against directory traversal vulnerabilities; the code directly uses file paths from the zip without validation.
performance: 5 - Efficient use of buffered reading and writing for small files.
maintainability: 3 - Simple implementation but could benefit from better error handling and input validation.
tests: 4 - Good basic test coverage for the core functionality, though missing edge case testing.

FINDINGS:
1) high - archive_utils.py - Path Traversal Vulnerability
   Evidence: target_path = os.path.join(dest_dir, name)
   Impact: Malicious zip files could write outside the destination directory.
   Fix: Validate that extracted paths are within the destination directory.

2) medium - archive_utils.py - Missing Error Handling
   Evidence: No exception handling for file I/O or zipfile operations.
   Impact: Crashes on corrupted zip files or permission errors.
   Fix: Add try/except blocks around file operations.

3) low - test_archive_utils.py - Limited Test Coverage
   Evidence: Only tests basic functionality with simple entries.
   Impact: Doesn't cover edge cases like empty files, special characters in names, or malformed zip files.
   Fix: Add more comprehensive test cases for edge conditions.

FIX PLAN:
- [ ] Add path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- [ ] Implement proper exception handling for file operations
- [ ] Enhance tests with edge case scenarios
- [ ] Add logging for debugging purposes
