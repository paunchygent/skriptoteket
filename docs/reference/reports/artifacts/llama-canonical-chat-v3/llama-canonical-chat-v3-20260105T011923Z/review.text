SUMMARY:
The code extracts files from a ZIP archive into a destination directory. The implementation handles nested directories and small file sizes. Tests cover basic extraction scenarios.

SCORECARD:
correctness: 4 - Handles basic extraction but lacks error handling for invalid inputs.
security: 3 - No path traversal protection or zip bomb checks.
performance: 3 - Reads entire files into memory, which may not scale for large files.
maintainability: 4 - Well-structured but lacks type hints for all parameters.
tests: 3 - Covers basic cases but missing edge cases like empty archives or malformed ZIPs.

FINDINGS:
1) medium - archive_utils.py - Missing path sanitization
   Evidence: `target_path = os.path.join(dest_dir, name)`
   Impact: Vulnerable to path traversal attacks if `name` contains `../`.
   Fix: Sanitize `name` to prevent directory traversal.

2) medium - archive_utils.py - No zip bomb protection
   Evidence: `data = src.read()`
   Impact: Could exhaust memory with maliciously large files.
   Fix: Add size limits or streaming extraction.

3) low - archive_utils.py - Inconsistent type hints
   Evidence: `dest_dir: str | Path` but no return type hint for helper functions.
   Impact: Reduces IDE support and readability.
   Fix: Add return type hints for all functions.

4) low - test_archive_utils.py - Missing edge case tests
   Evidence: Only tests basic extraction.
   Impact: May miss bugs in error handling.
   Fix: Add tests for empty archives, malformed ZIPs, and path traversal attempts.

FIX PLAN:
- [ ] Add path sanitization to prevent directory traversal.
- [ ] Implement zip bomb protection with size limits.
- [ ] Add consistent type hints for all functions.
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases.
